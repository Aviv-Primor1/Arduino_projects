## 🚀 Projects

### 1️⃣ Joystick-Controlled LED and Buzzer System  
🔹 **Description:** A joystick-based control system that lights up different LEDs and activates a buzzer based on movement direction and button press.  
🔹 **Components Used:**  
- Arduino Uno  
- Joystick module  
- LEDs (4x)  
- Buzzer  

🔹 **Features:**  
✅ LED indicators for joystick movement (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)  
✅ Buzzer feedback with varying tones  
✅ Serial monitor output for real-time data

### 2️⃣ Ultrasonic Distance Detection with Servo  
🔹 **Description:** A distance measurement system that uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan an area and trigger a buzzer when an obstacle is detected within a threshold range.  
🔹 **Components Used:**  
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo Motor  
- Buzzer  

🔹 **Features:**  
✅ Servo-controlled scanning motion (0° - 180°)  
✅ Distance measurement in real-time  
✅ Buzzer alarm when an object is closer than 5 cm
